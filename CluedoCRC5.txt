Notes: square is too different from room for room to be classed as or behave 
    like a square, but could be abstracted as an empty interface called Place. 
    Characters and Weapons only responsibilities are as identifiers, hense Card.
    Excluding tracking of anything as a responsibility as iralivant at this
    stage. Cards are just identities and Room/Player have identity that relates
    to cards
